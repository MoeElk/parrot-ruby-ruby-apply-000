Squawk= #{variable}
def parrot
  puts= 
end




In this lab you'll be defining a method called `parrot`.

The `parrot` method should accept an argument of a string and both `puts` out
that string _and_ return the string at the end of the method.

The `parrot` method should have a default argument of `"Squawk!"`.
